I grew up in TCV, a Tibetan school in India, that had abundant stone tables for kids to play table tennis. It started out as a fun sport to challenge my friends and outwit them with fast placement of the ball to either left or right side. There would be a lot of running left and right around the table. Of course, if anyone returned any high balls, we would take the opportunity to smash the ball. In grade 10 when I moved to boys hostel, the school had professional wooden table. The students there were more focussed on using spins, control and power. \")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" When I moved to Canada, I played table tennis in school, community centers and in outdoor areas. I met Coach Deryck in a community center. He is a passionate person who taught me table tennis elements in a new light. His playstyle was very logical, almost like a programming language and I quickly absorbed his knowledge: every move had an easy and perfect counter. Top spins would be countered by top spins; under spins with under spins; side spins with its complementary side spin; there is also the neutral 'block' which is useful in almost all situations. It is important to be quick-witted and make instant judgements on how and where to return the ball. \")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" There is also the physical aspect to this sport. The obvious part is the stamina needed to play long games and basic strength to smash an easy ball. There is also positioning or the spatial aspect to the game. Repetitive practice improves the player's form and tempo. The wrist along with the whole body will enable the player to return the ball to wherever they want it to. Practice then familiarises the player about their arm range, so it is important to reset body position to be able to return all types of balls. Good dynamic vision will be an asset in making optimal decisions in the game. \")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" There were a few years or months here and there that I took breaks from table tennis. It was during such a time in late 2015 when I learned of a tournament in University of Toronto. I met challenging and tough players but I was able to win the tournament of pool B. It was nice of the organizers to reward me with a UofT sports T-shirt and a certificate. \")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" Throughout my life, especially recently, I have noticed that playing table tennis helps keep me healthy and fit. I believe this sport is a great combination of physical and mental fitness. \")])])}]\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./TableTennisMore.vue?vue&type=template&id=170c83ac&\"\nvar script = {}\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports"],"sourceRoot":""}
