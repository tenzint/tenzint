      In grade 5 or 6 back in my Tibetan school in India, when internet was rare
      and inaccessible to students, I believed that I had invented the 3-move
      "Scholar's mate". It was a good moment for me, outsmarting my friends. Of
      course, I later learned that I had neither invented that checkmate pattern
      nor was it impressive.

      Chess involves a lot of critical thinking and an analytical mind to be
      able to outwit their opponent. I have played many games throughout my life
      both on board and online. I was able to make many brilliant moves along
      with obvious one-move blunders.

      My online chess
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" target="_blank"
        >ELO rating</a

      is around 1600s in classical, blitz and bullet modes.

      There are online chess database with hundreds of thousands of games along
      with video tutorials, or game samples for an interested player to study
      and improve. Such experts and tutors include the current world champion,
      Magnus Carlsen, along with other grandmasters (GM).

      My chess experience is limited to the games that I play. My favourite
      black opening is the Sicilian defense. I am not fond of memorizing chess
      openings, common tropes, tricks and traps. I have stopped playing online
      chess a few years ago. I am still open to playing board chess but finding
      such players are rare around me.
