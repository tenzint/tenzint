      Table tennis or ping pong is my favourite sport from childhood till date. I grew up in TCV, a
      Tibetan school in India, that had abundant stone tables for kids to play table tennis. It
      started out as a fun sport to challenge my friends and outwit them with fast placement of the
      ball to either left or right side. There would be a lot of running left and right around the
      table. Of course, if anyone returned any high balls, we would take the opportunity to smash
      the ball. In grade 10 when I moved to boys hostel, the school had professional wooden table.
      The students there were more focussed on using spins, control and power.

      When I moved to Canada, I played table tennis in school, community centers and in outdoor
      areas. I met Coach Deryck in a community center. He is a passionate person who taught me table
      tennis elements in a new light. His playstyle was very logical, almost like a programming
      language and I quickly absorbed his knowledge: every move had an easy and perfect counter. Top
      spins would be countered by top spins; under spins with under spins; side spins with its
      complementary side spin; there is also the neutral 'block' which is useful in almost all
      situations. It is important to be quick-witted and make instant judgements on how and where to
      return the ball.

      There is also the physical aspect to this sport. The obvious part is the stamina needed to
      play long games and basic strength to smash an easy ball. There is also positioning or the
      spatial aspect to the game. Repetitive practice improves the player's form and tempo. The
      wrist along with the whole body will enable the player to return the ball to wherever they
      want it to. Practice then familiarises the player about their arm range, so it is important to
      reset body position to be able to return all types of balls. Good dynamic vision will be an
      asset in making optimal decisions in the game.

      There were a few years or months here and there that I took breaks from table tennis. It was
      during such a time in late 2015 when I learned of a tournament in University of Toronto. I met
      challenging and tough players but I was able to win the tournament of pool B. It was nice of
      the organizers to reward me with a UofT sports T-shirt and a certificate.

      Throughout my life, especially recently, I have noticed that playing table tennis helps keep
      me healthy and fit. I believe this sport is a great combination of physical and mental
      fitness.
