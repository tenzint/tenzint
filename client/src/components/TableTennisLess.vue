    <p>Table tennis or ping pong is my favourite sport from childhood till date.</p>
    <p>
      I met Coach Deryck in a community center. He is a passionate person who taught me table tennis
      elements in a new light - almost like a programming language.

      I learned of a tournament in University of Toronto. I met challenging and tough players but I
      was able to win the tournament of pool B.

    <p>I believe this sport is a great combination of physical and mental fitness.</p>
